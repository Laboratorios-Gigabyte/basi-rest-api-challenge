# Code Challenges

1. Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

Example 1:
```text
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3

Explanation: 
The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```

Example 2:
```text
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
```

2. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
```text
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

Example 2:
```text
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```
